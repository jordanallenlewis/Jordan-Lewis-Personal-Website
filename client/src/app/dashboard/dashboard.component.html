      I'm currently a senior in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering Computer Science Program at Arizona State University. I have interned the last three summers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where I've gained real world experience working in a research and development environment.   </p>  
  <p class="b">
      Apart from my academic life, I enjoy keeping active and training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at the Charles Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy. I'm a member of the Software Developers Association (SoDA) and participate in weekly meetings to expand my involvement in the engineering community and connect with other students that are passionate about programming and software engineering.  </p>
